 Drugs Side Effects Visualization Project

This project focuses on **visualizing the side effects of various pharmaceutical drugs** using data analysis and interactive charts. It helps identify trends, frequencies, and relationships between drugs and their associated side effects.

Project Goals

- Analyze and visualize the frequency and distribution of drug side effects
- Use interactive and static charts to present patterns and insights
- Assist researchers, students, and healthcare professionals in understanding drug safety data

Visualizations Used

-  Line Charts – Track trends over time or frequency
-  Bar Charts – Compare side effects across different drugs
-  Treemaps – Visualize hierarchical drug-side effect relationships
-  Histograms – Show distribution of side effect occurrences

 Tools & Technologies

Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
